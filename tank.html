            <i>Tank!</i> is a game inspired by the <i>Tanks</i> minigame in <i>Wii Play</i>, independently develeopd in 10 days during March 2023. Building the gameplay features for this game allowed me to refine, and refactor some of the game-agnostic
            core systems I created for <a href="kart-racer.html">Kario Kart</a> and <a href="descension.html">Descension</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Some key development accomplishments include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized behaviour trees to create extensible and customizable AI behaviour.</li>
            <li>Experimented with NavMeshes and NavMesh agents for pathfinding.</li>
            <li>Refactored and extended the <a href="kart-racer.html">Kario Kart</a> UI library.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            In the future, I would love to add 2 player online mulitplayer. I think that both co-op and deathmatch gamemodes would be well-suited for the gameplay systems, and it would be a really fun challenge. Theres also a lot of room for visual improvements to
            the game, such as better explosions, tank trails, and environment assets. The game is also completely lacking audio, which would add a lot to the presentation, but I deemed wasn't a priority.
