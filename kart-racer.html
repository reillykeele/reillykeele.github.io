        <h1>Kart Racer (W.I.P.)</h1>
        
        <p>
            This solo endeavor serves as a concrete Unity 3D project to demonstrate my gameplay programming skills, as well as 
            an opportunity to expand my Unity knowledge through exploration and experimentation. The focus of this project is
            not on design, but rather, implementing technical solutions to achieve an existing design (in this case, Mario Kart). 
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is a solo project, limiting scope, and having well-defined goals is critical to completing and releasing This
            project. Holding myself accountable and pushing myself to learn new things, and discover creative solutions to solve 
            difficult problems has been difficult, but worthwhile. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While the project is not yet complete, some key areas that I've gained new experience in throughout development:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3D Character Controllers</li>
            <li>3D Cameras (Cinemachine)</li>
            <li>Generalizing behaviours through polymorphism</li>
            <li>Designing and implementing responsive, juicy, gamepad-friendly UIs</li>
            <li>Designing and programming believable racer AI behaviour</li>
            <li>Shaders and particle systems (URP)</li>
            <li>Utilizing event-driven patterns to reduce coupling and improve performance</li>
            <li>Reducing/limiting the need for singletons (a problem in pervious team projects)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity 2020.3.26f1 LTS</li>
            <li>C#</li>
        </ul>
