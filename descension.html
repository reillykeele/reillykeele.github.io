        <p>Working with a team of 4 programmers and a writer, <i>Descension</i> is a top-down action dungeon-crawler built using Unity 2D for the University of Alberta's game development capstone course, INT D 450.</p>
        <p>
            This project served as a great way to sharpen my skills in Unity, as well as practice designing and building scalable and efficient systems that are still maintainable and readable. Futher, I also gained experience in sprint planning and DevOps management
            through Jira, as well as some experience with CI/CD tools for running automated builds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our project faced some adversity throughout the term: a group member, our artist, left the team mid-way through for personal reasons. Additionally, our team did not have a dedicated composer/musician. As a result, we utilized free and open-source assets
            and leveridged techniques like palette swapping to fit our aesthetic. Some art tasks were divided amongst remaining group members.
