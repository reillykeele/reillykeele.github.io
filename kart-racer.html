        <p>
            This solo endeavor serves as a concrete Unity 3D project to demonstrate my gameplay programming skills, as well as an 
            opportunity to expand my Unity knowledge through exploration and experimentation. The focus of this project is not on 
            design, but rather, on implementing technical solutions to achieve an existing design (in this case, Mario Kart). 
        </p>
        <p>
            As this is a solo project, limiting the scope, and having well-defined goals is critical to completing and releasing 
            This project. Holding myself accountable, pushing myself to learn new things, and discovering creative solutions to 
            complex problems has been challenging, but worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the project is not yet complete, some key areas that I've gained new experience in throughout development:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>3D Character Controllers</li>
            <li>3D Cameras (Cinemachine)</li>
            <li>Generalizing behaviours through polymorphism</li>
            <li>Designing and implementing responsive, juicy, gamepad-friendly UIs</li>
            <li>Designing and programming believable racer AI behaviour</li>
            <li>Surface-level knowlege of shaders and particle systems (URP)</li>
            <li>Utilizing event-driven patterns to reduce coupling and improve performance</li>
            <li>Reducing/limiting the need for singletons (a problem in pervious team projects)</li>
            <li>Audio programming (a weak area for me)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Tools and Technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity 2020.3.26f1 LTS</li>
            <li>C#</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
